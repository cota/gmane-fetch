gmane-fetch
===========

Being tired of reading lkml through IMAP, I decided to search for faster
solutions. I came across the exporting facility that gmane provides [
http://gmane.org/export.php ] and quickly wrote a couple of scripts to fetch
the messages for me.

Usage
-----
Fill the .listname file with the full "gmane" name of the list, and run
update.sh. An mbox file will be created; the name of the file is the latest
gmane message of the selected list.

Example:

	echo "comp.version-control.patchwork" > .listname
	./update.sh
	Downloading messages 0-20... OK
	Downloading messages 20-40... OK
	[...]
	Downloading messages 500-504... OK

Now we can read the first 504 messages of the list, for instance with

	mutt -f 504

You may not want to retrieve all messages in a list, especially if the list
has heavy traffic. If we just want to retrieve messages from id 500 onwards,
we'd add this line to the instructions above, right before ./update.sh:

	touch 499

The gmane id of a message is very simple to retrieve. I normally browse the
list archives of the one I'm interested in through gmane's web interface;
the gmane id of each message is at the end of each message's hyperlink.
